## 💻 Code Overview 💻

The HTML code is structured with Bootstrap classes to provide a responsive layout. It is decorated with FontAwesome icons and custom CSS styles to provide a pleasing user interface.

JavaScript and the Chart.js library are used to generate bar and line charts with sample data.

The Bootstrap's navigation bar component is used in the application with customization, such as adding notification and profile dropdowns.

Exchange rates are intended to be dynamically populated with the script "doviz.js", which is not included in the HTML.
